# Date structure
This project works with dates.
First print the date (for example: 23/04/2020).Use this sign "/".
Then you will know what date will come earlier.
Next, using the formula, you will find out what day of the week these dates were. 
Also you will know the difference between dates.


I uploaded the screenshots so you know how to work with code
Good luck!
